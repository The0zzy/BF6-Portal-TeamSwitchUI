# BF6-Portal-TeamSwitchUI

A generic teamswitch UI for any BF6 custom portal mode.

## How it works

It will spawn an interact point in front of a spawned player.
When interacting it will open a dialog to choose the team.
The dialog and interact point can also be disabled for the rest of the match by selecting "DONT SHOW AGAIN".
The interact point will automatically vanish if the player moves or doesn't interact for 3 seconds.
